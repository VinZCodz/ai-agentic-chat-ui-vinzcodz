- The main chat component is present under `app/components/Chat.tsx` which is the orchestrator for this chat UI
- Add more custom react or tweak the existing components under `app/components`
- Add your own site configurations under `app/config/site.ts` 
- Replace with your own brand icon under `public/icon.png`
